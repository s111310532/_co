// This Pong game code was originally written in the high-level Jack language.
// The Jack code was then translated by the Jack compiler into VM code.
// The VM code was then translated by the VM translator into the Hack
// assembly code shown here. The variable and label symbols were generated
// automatically by the translators. This information is given for context only.
// Jack, the Jack compiler, and the VM translator are covered in Part II
// of the course, and are irrelevant for project 6
